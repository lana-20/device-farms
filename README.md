# Device Farms

Device farms, also known as device labs or device clouds, are collections of mobile devices that can be used for testing mobile applications. Testers may need to use device farms in the following situations:

1. Testing on a wide range of devices: Device farms can be used to test an application on a large number of devices with different hardware configurations, operating systems, and screen sizes. This is useful for ensuring compatibility and functionality across a diverse set of devices.

2. Testing on physical devices: While it is possible to test mobile applications using emulators or simulators, there are certain features that can only be tested on real devices. Device farms allow testers to test on physical devices, providing a more accurate representation of how the application will behave in the real world.

3. Testing on devices in different locations: Device farms can be used to test an application on devices located in different parts of the world, allowing testers to verify that the application works correctly in different time zones and under different network conditions.

3. Testing on devices with different languages: Device farms can be used to test an application on devices with different language settings, allowing testers to verify that the application is localized correctly and functions properly in different languages.

5. Testing on devices with different accessibility options: Device farms can be used to test an application on devices with different accessibility options, such as screen readers or different font sizes, allowing testers to verify that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.

6. Testing on devices that are not readily available: Device farms can be used to test on devices that may not be readily available to the testing team, such as older or obscure devices, allowing testers to verify that the application works correctly on these devices.

7. Testing on devices in parallel: Device farms can be used to test multiple devices simultaneously, allowing testers to speed up the testing process and complete testing in a shorter period of time.


A device farm is an app testing service that allows developers and quality assurance (QA) engineers to interact with and test Android, iOS, and web apps. This can be done through real, physical devices that the dev can temporarily get for testing or it can be done through cloud-based access to devices which are used to remotely run and test apps in real time.

There are several popular [cloud-based device farms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSELD-zHBcVAQLY2ZFK-_btUkl4bPiyA0kXueROkL4uEqI-ahpiuuFD1LTxrPT5-GZJxO-6TB0a5u-8/pubhtml) currently available. The following chart features specialized professional device farms which give remote access to power the testing of applications, offering different packages. Some of these also provide an automated option that sends screenshots or logs of the testing conducted so that devs and QA engineers can review and verify the results of the testing.
